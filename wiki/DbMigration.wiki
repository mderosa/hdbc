I've worked in too many places where it never occurred to the developers that versioning and managing the database systematically is a fundamental prerequisite for managing a product.  So instead of reinventing one of these everywhere I go, here is one I hope to keep and improve for the long term.

= The basics of managing the database = 
  * Have a version table that represents the update state of the database - a single number in the table will do
  * Log all changes and who does the changes and when
  * Be able to run the version up or down
  * Automate everything so there are no mistakes and everything is repeatable
